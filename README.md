As a user, I'd like to sign-up to the website so that I can have access to the game.
As a user, I'd like to be able to sign-in subsequently so that I can start a new game.
As a user, I'd like be able to play and have the computer shout at me who wins/doesn't win and have my # of played games saved.
As a user, I'd like to be able to log-out and log back in freely and change my password in case someone gets sneaky.
